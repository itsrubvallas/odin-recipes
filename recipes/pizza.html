      A pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a round, flatbread base
      topped with various ingredients, typically including tomato sauce, cheese
      (often mozzarella), and a variety of toppings such as pepperoni,
      mushrooms, onions, peppers, olives, and meats like sausage or ham. The
      pizza is then baked in an oven, resulting in a delicious, savory meal
      enjoyed worldwide for its versatility and flavor combinations.

        <li>Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>
          Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise in a
          warm place until it doubles in size, usually about 1-2 hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Preheat the oven</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, typically
          around 475-500°F (245-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in
          the oven while preheating.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Prepare the toppings</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          While the dough is rising, prepare your toppings. This includes
          slicing any vegetables, grating cheese, and preparing any meats.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Shape the dought</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.</li>
        <li>
          On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a round shape,
          about 12-14 inches (30-35 cm) in diameter. You can adjust the
          thickness to your preference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Assemble the pizza</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transfer the rolled-out dough to a lightly greased pizza pan or baking
          sheet, or onto a preheated pizza stone if using.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread a layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small
          border around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings evenly over the cheese layer.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Bake the pizza</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Carefully transfer the assembled pizza into the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>
          Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the
          cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the pizza while it bakes to prevent burning.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a
          few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice the pizza into wedges and serve hot. You can drizzle olive oil
          or sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs over the top before
          serving, if desired.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
